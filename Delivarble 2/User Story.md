## III. User Story Verification
### 1. Project Context and Objectives (E-OMS)

The project involves designing an integrated **E-OMS** for E-Market Inc.. The system must model and automate the **full order lifecycle**—from product catalog to final delivery.

- **Core Problem:** The project aims to overcome operational inefficiencies arising from reliance on **disconnected tools**, which currently cause **data duplication, communication gaps, and stock errors**.
- **Primary Goal:** To **automate and streamline the entire order process**, **ensure accuracy and synchronization between departments**, and **strengthen coordination with external partners**.
- **Stakeholders:** Analysis focused on four key stakeholder categories: **Internal Operational Staff** (Sales, Finance, Inventory, etc.), **External Operational Customers**, **External Partners** (Couriers, Suppliers), and **Executive Stakeholders** (Management, Admins).

### 2. Systems Analysis Activity and Techniques Used

Our activities align with the Systems Development Lifecycle (SDLC), specifically **Core Process 3: Discover and Understand Details** (System Analysis-Requirements Engineering), where identifying requirements is critical.

- **Technique:** We applied the **User Story** technique, which is favored by highly agile system development methodologies. User stories document **functional requirements** quickly and less formally.
- **Format:** All functional requirements were written using the standard template: **"As a `<role>` I want to `<goal>` so that `<benefit>`"**.
- **Acceptance Criteria:** For each story, we defined **Acceptance Criteria** (using the Given-When-Then format). These criteria identify the features that must be present at completion and serve as a **contract between the developers and the users**.

### 3. Verification of Effectiveness

We verified the effectiveness of the generated user stories and Acceptance Criteria based on the rules outlined in the sources:
- **User Story Verification:** Each story was confirmed to be effective because it:
    - **Covers a small chunk of functionality**.
    - **Delivers value on its own**.
    - Is written in a **simple way** to be **understood by everyone**.
    - **Does not include the solution or heavy technical information**.
- **Criteria Verification:** The Acceptance Criteria were verified to clarify exceptions and ensure the user story was defined at an appropriate level of analysis, defining the necessary observable outcome and expected results.
