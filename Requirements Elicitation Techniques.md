| **1. Interviews**                  | Conduct structured interviews with key stakeholders such as Sales, Finance, Inventory, Logistics, and Customer Support departments. Each department will explain its current workflow, challenges, and expectations from the system. | Interviews allow in-depth understanding of department-specific needs and uncover hidden requirements that might not appear in written documents. |
| **2. Questionnaires / Surveys**    | Distribute online surveys to a larger group of employees and customers to collect opinions about desired system features, usability, and performance expectations.                                                                   | Surveys reach a wider audience quickly, helping identify common requirements and priorities from many users.                                     |
| **3.

| **4. Document Analysis**           | Review existing company reports, sales records, and order processing forms to identify the flow of information between departments.                                                                                                  | Provides factual data about current processes, inputs, and outputs, ensuring that system requirements are based on real business practices.      |
