# System Vision Document: E-Commerce Order Management System (E-OMS)

### 1. Purpose (Problem Description)

The fundamental purpose of the E-OMS project is to overcome critical operational inefficiencies resulting from E-Market Inc.’s reliance on **conventional e-commerce systems that utilize disconnected tools**. This fragmented system approach currently leads to significant challenges, including **data duplication, communication gaps, and stock errors**. The E-OMS is required to model and automate the **full order lifecycle—from order placement to final delivery** —by implementing an integrated system that connects major internal departments and external partners.

### 2. Scope (System Capabilities and Boundaries)

The E-OMS is designed as an **integrated system** connecting Sales, Finance, Inventory, Logistics, and Customer Support, and integrates with external entities such as suppliers, courier services, and payment gateways. **Inclusions (Core Scope):** The project scope includes end-to-end order management, covering the entire lifecycle from placement through final delivery. Key capabilities are designed to handle:

- **Order Validation and Processing:** Automated recording and generation of a unique Order ID upon placement, followed by validation of details, product data, and customer information.
- **Financial Processing:** Secure payment handling, sending details to a gateway for authorization, and confirming payment (or triggering automatic cancellation upon failure). The system also handles the generation of detailed invoices.
- **Inventory and Logistics:** **Real-time inventory tracking and reservation**. If products are out of stock, a replenishment request is sent to suppliers. The system plans shipment, determines routes, selects a courier, and assigns a tracking number and estimated delivery date.
- **Product Catalog Management:** Authorized inventory staff can **add, update, or delete products**, including details such as product name, description, and price, ensuring an up-to-date product catalog.
- **Customer Interaction:** Email/SMS notifications for every stage of the order process, and support for the **returns and refunds workflow**.

**Exclusions (Limitations):** The E-OMS project is strictly focused on core order management. It specifically **excludes marketing or recommendation systems**. It also **excludes accounting or Human Resources (HR) modules**. The functioning of courier delivery, supplier management, and payment authorization are reliant upon the stability and function of external partners’ systems, which are outside the control of the E-OMS.

### 3. Goals (Business Benefits)

The primary goals of the E-OMS are to centralize core processes and provide business value by:

1. **Increase Operational Efficiency:** The system is intended to **automate and streamline the entire order process** and **minimize manual work**, which will directly result in **reduced delays** and higher overall operational efficiency.
2. **Improve Data Accuracy and Coordination:** A critical goal is to **ensure accuracy and synchronization between departments** by resolving the communication gaps and data duplication challenges identified in the problem.
3. **Strengthen Partner Relations:** The system aims to **strengthen coordination with external partners** (including suppliers and couriers).
4. **Maximize Customer Experience:** The E-OMS goal is to **offer customers real-time order tracking and updates**, and ensure satisfaction through efficient handling of post-delivery issues.

## SECTION III: Functional Requirements (System Capabilities)

Functional requirements define the activities the system must perform. Please answer the following based on the required E-OMS capabilities:

3. **Order Validation (Sales/Verification):** When validating an order, what percentage of necessary customer and product data is typically missing or inaccurate in the current system?
    - [ ] Less than 5%
    - [ ] 5%–15%
    - [ ] 16%–30%
    - [ ] More than 30%
4. **Product Catalog Management (If Applicable):** If you are responsible for adding products, what is the single most time-consuming step in defining a new product and its description?
    - 
        
5. **Inventory Tracking & Reservation (Inventory/Warehouse):** How quickly do you need inventory levels to update after an item is reserved or replenished?
    - [ ] Immediately (Real-time)
    - [ ] Within 10 minutes
    - [ ] Within 1 hour
    - [ ] End of day
6. **Logistics & Shipping (Logistics):** What is the most common reason for shipment planning delays (e.g., incorrect customer address format, missing courier rate information, etc.)?
    - 
        
7. **Customer Support (Support):** When managing returns and refunds, what information does the current system lack that would most improve resolution time?
    - 
        

## SECTION IV: Non-Functional Requirements (FURPS+)

Non-functional requirements describe system characteristics, constraints, and performance goals. Please rate the importance of the following characteristics for the new E-OMS (1=Not Important, 5=Absolutely Critical):

|Requirement Type (FURPS+)|Characteristic|1 (NI)|2 (LI)|3 (M)|4 (I)|5 (AC)|
|:--|:--|:--|:--|:--|:--|:--|
|**Performance**|**P1:** The system must process payment authorization and update inventory reservation status within 5 seconds.|[ ]|[ ]|[ ]|[ ]|[ ]|
|**Reliability**|**R1:** The system must be available 24/7, with no unscheduled downtime.|[ ]|[ ]|[ ]|[ ]|[ ]|
|**Usability**|**U1:** The user interface (screens/reports) must be simple enough to require less than 1 hour of new user training per module.|[ ]|[ ]|[ ]|[ ]|[ ]|
|**Security**|**S1:** The system must meet all current industry standards for securely handling customer payment details (Finance).|[ ]|[ ]|[ ]|[ ]|[ ]|

8. **Open Feedback:** Please provide any additional suggestions regarding current processes or essential features the new E-OMS must include to make your job more efficient.

## Jira
>Our team utilized Jira for the comprehensive organization and monitoring of Deliverable #1. We structured the project by creating a main Epic, Deliverable #1: System Analysis & Requirements, which served as a container for all related work. This Epic was broken down into User Stories, with each story corresponding to a major section of the technical report, such as the System Vision Document and Workflow Documentation. To ensure clear accountability and a granular breakdown of work, some stories were further divided into specific sub-tasks, which were then assigned to individual team members based on their project roles. Progress was actively monitored using our board, allowing the team leader to visually track tasks as they moved from To Do to In Progress and Done, ensuring all project goals were met on schedule.
